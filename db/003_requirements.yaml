question: |-
  Give me the content of requirements.txt file and change the setup.py file to contain following requirements: openai, PyYAML, argcomplete.
answer: |-
  For the `requirements.txt` file, add the following content:

  ```
  openai
  PyYAML
  argcomplete
  ```

  Now, update the `setup.py` file to include these requirements:

  ```python
  from setuptools import setup, find_packages

  with open("README.md", "r", encoding="utf-8") as fh:
      long_description = fh.read()

  setup(
      name="ChatMastermind",
      version="0.1.0",
      author="Your Name",
      author_email="your.email@example.com",
      description="A Python application to automate conversation with AI, store question+answer pairs, and compose chat history.",
      long_description=long_description,
      long_description_content_type="text/markdown",
      url="https://github.com/yourusername/ChatMastermind",
      packages=find_packages(),
      classifiers=[
          "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha",
          "Intended Audience :: Developers",
          "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
          "Operating System :: OS Independent",
          "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
          "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6",
          "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.7",
          "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8",
          "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9",
      ],
      install_requires=[
          "openai",
          "PyYAML",
          "argcomplete",
      ],
      python_requires=">=3.6",
      entry_points={
          "console_scripts": [
              "chatmastermind=chatmastermind.main:main",
          ],
      },
  )
  ```

  This will include the "openai", "PyYAML", and "argcomplete" packages as dependencies for your project.
